## About this bot

This is a Telegram bot implemented in Python programming language. The bot has various functions, including playing a guessing game, changing settings, and displaying help information. The bot is interactive and uses inline keyboards to present options to the user. When the user chooses to play the game, the bot selects a random song and sends lyrics to the user one by one. The user has to guess the name of the song. If the user guesses correctly, the bot sends a success message; otherwise, the game ends after a set number of attempts, and the bot sends a failure message. The bot also allows the user to change the language and theme of the game.
