the bot selects a random song and sends lyrics to the user one by one. The user has to guess the name of the song. If the user guesses correctly, the bot sends a success message; otherwise, the game ends after a set number of attempts, and the bot sends a failure message. The bot also allows the user to change the language and theme of the game.
